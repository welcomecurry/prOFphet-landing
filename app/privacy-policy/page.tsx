      <p>We may also disclose any Non-Personal Information collected to third parties for any business purpose.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Links to Other Websites</h2>
      <p>PrOFphet may contain or in certain instances generate links to our service providers’ websites or apps or to other websites or apps that are not under PrOFphet’s direct control, including, without limitation, onlyfans.com. PrOFphet has no control over or responsibility for linked websites or apps and provides these links solely for Your convenience and information. You access such linked websites and apps at Your own risk. These websites and apps are not subject to this Privacy Policy and have their own policies regarding privacy. You should check the privacy policies, if any, of those individual websites and apps to see how the operators of those third-party websites will utilize Your information.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Payments</h2>
      <p>PrOFphet uses third-party services for payment processing (payment processors). PrOFphet will not store or collect your payment card or bank account details. Such information is provided directly to Lydian’s third-party payment processors whose use of Your Personally Identifiable Information is governed by their respective privacy policies. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Do Not Track Disclosures</h2>
      <p>Your browser settings may allow You to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services You visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what website and app operators should do with regard to these signals. PrOFphet does not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
      <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. PrOFphet does not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old, and does not accept users under the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which they reside.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Security</h2>
      <p>PrOFphet securely protects your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access. PrOFphet takes measures in accordance with industry standards to protect Your Personally Identifiable Information from any alterations, accidental or unlawful destruction, or theft. But You should also be aware that when information is transmitted over the Internet, transmissions are subject to a certain amount of risk, as is data stored at rest, and therefore PrOFphet cannot guarantee You that Your Personally Identifiable Information will never be compromised.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
      <p>PrOFphet uses third-party service providers to read and summarize messages, interactions and creates new suggested replies to comment and direct messages you share with PrOFphet by using its services and apps. PrOFphet assumes you are the owner of the content and PrOFphet also creates new suggested replies to comment and direct messages. We will share your personal information with third-parties only to the extent necessary to provide this service.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Right to Opt Out</h2>
      <p>Please note that after You register for a PrOFphet account, subscribe to PrOFphet or PrOFphet emails or text messages, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or contact PrOFphet for any purpose, You may receive emails, text messages, and/or app notifications from AI Digital LLC or third parties on PrOFphet’s behalf informing You of products and services, promotions, suggestions based on Your Platform usage patterns, etc. You may opt out of receiving such communications from PrOFphet, third parties, or both, by contacting PrOFphet by emailing us at info[at]ofans.ai.</p>
